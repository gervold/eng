### Reported speach

- Denis: "I will be late."  
- Parents: "Okay."

He told his parents that he would be late.

#### Direct speech vs reported speech
_Direct speech:_
Denis said **,**  **"** I'm feeling ill **"** (using comma and quotation marks)

_Reported speech:_
Denis said that he was feeling ill.

#### Present --> Past

When we use reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past (Denis **said** that ...).
The rest of the sentence is usually past too:
- Denis **said** that he **was feeling** ill.
- I **told** Lena that I didn't have any money.

You can leave out **that**:

|that| without that|
|---|---|
|Denis **said** that he **was feeling** ill|Denis **said** he **was feeling** ill|

In general, the _present_ form _in direct_ speech changes to the _past_ form _in reported_ speech:

|Direct|Reported|
|---|---|
|am/is|was|
|are|were|
|do/does|did|
|have/has|had|
|will|would|
|can|could|
|want/like/know/go|wanted/liked/knew/went|
|etc|...|

Compare:

|Direct|Reported|
|---|---|
|Lena: 'My parents are very well.|Lena said that her parents **were** very well.|
|Lena: 'I want to buy a car'| She said that she **wanted** to by a car.| 
|'I can't come to the party on Friday'|She said that she couldn't come to the party on Friday|

#### Past --> Past/Past Perfect

The _past simple_ (**did/saw/knew** etc.) can usually stay _the same_, or you can change it to the _past perfect_ (**had done/had seen/had known** etc):

|Direct|Reported|
|---|---|
|Denis said: 'I **woke** up feeling ill, so I **didn't go** to work.|Denis said (that) he **woke** up feeling ill, so he **didn't go** to the work.|
| - | _or_ Denis said (that) he **had woken** up feeling ill, so he **hadn't gone** to the work. |
