## Prepositional and Phrasal Verbs

#### Prepositional Verbs Examples

_to look at_

- I'm _looking at_ the sky.
- Can you see the sky?
- Yes, I'm _looking_ (no object, so we dropped the preposition).

_to talk_

- I am talking now.
- I will talk at 3 pm.
- I am talking to you.
- I'm talking about phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs.


#### There are differences between phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs

1. Phrasal Verb is a 2 or 3 part verb that has a verb and a particle (adverb)

- to pick (= to choose) 
- to pick up

2. Separable and Inseparable Phrasal Verbs

to pick up

- I picked up the pen.
- I picked the pen up.
- I picked it up.


3. Phrasal Verbs sometimes have multiple meanings

- Please pick me up at the airport (= Please fetch me from the airport)


4. If the object is really long, keep the phrasal verb together.

- I _picked up_ the new recruits from the Chinese firm that we hired.
- **NOT:** I _picked_ the new recruits from the Chinese firm that we hired _up_.
