### Would

We use **would ('d)**/**wouldn't** when we _imagine_ a situation or action ( = we think of something that is not real):  

- It **would be** nice to buy a new car, but we can't afford it.
- I'**d love** to live to by the sea.
- A: Shall I tell Denis what happened?  
  B: No, I **wouldn't say** any (I wouldn't say anything in your situation)

#### Past

We use **would have (done)** when we _imagine_ a situation or action in the past (= things that didn't happen):
- They helped us a lot. We don't know what we'**d have done** (=would have done) without their help.
- I didn't tell Alex what happened. He **wouldn't have been** pleased.

Comparing

|would (do)|would have (done)|
|---|---|
|I **would phone** Lena, but I haven't got her number (_now_)|I **would have phoned** Lena, but I did't have her number (_past_)

We often use **would** in sentences **with if**:
- I **would** phone Lena **if** I had her number.
- I **would have phoned** Lena **if** I'd had her number.
