### If I do ... and If I did ...

Compare these examples:

|Case 1| Case 2|
|---|---|
|Lena has lost her watch. She tell Denis:<br> Lena: I've lost my watch. Have you seen it anywhere?"<br> Denis: No, but **if I find** it, **I'll** tell you.|Denis says:<br>If I found a wallet in the street, I'd take it to the police station.|
|In this example, Denis feels there is a _real possibility_ that he will find the watch.  | This is a different type of situation. <br> Here, Denis _doesn't expect to find_ a wallet in the street; he is _imagining_ a situation that will probably not happen. |
|So he says: <br> **if I find** ..., **I'll** ... . | So he says: <br> **if I found** ..., **I'd** (= **I would**) ... .(_not_ if I find ..., I'll ...) |

When you imagine smth like this, you use **if** + _past_  
(**If** I **found** / **if** there **was** / **if** we **didn't** etc.)

But the meaning is _not_ past **(!)**:
- What would you do if you won a million pounds?
  (we don't really expect this to happen)
- I don't really want to go to their party, but I probably will go.  
They'd be upset **if I didn't** go.
- **If** there **was** (_or_ **were**) an election tomorrow, who would you vote for?

We do not normally use would in the if-part of the sentence:

- I'd very frightened if somebody pointed a gun at me. (_not_ if somebody would point)
- If I didn't go to their party, they'd be upset. (_not_ If I wouldn't go)

But you can use **if** ... **would** when you ask somebody to do smth:
- (_from a formal letter_) I would be grateful if you would let me know your decision as soon as possible.  

--- 

In the other part of sentence (not the **if**-part) we use would('d)/wouldn't:
- if you took more exercise, you'**d** (= you **would**) feel better.
- I'm not tired. If I went to bed now, I **wouldn't** sleep.
- **Would** you **mind** if I used your phone?

Could and might are also possible:  
- if you took more exercise, you **might** feel better. (= it is possible that you would feel better)
- if it stopped raining, we **could** go out. (= we would be able to go out)

---

Do not use when in sentences like those on this page:
- They'd be upset **if** I didn't go to their party. (_not_ when I didn't go)
- What would you do **if** you were bitten by a snake? (_not_ when you were bitten)
