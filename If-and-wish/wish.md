### Wish

You can say '**I wish you luck/every success/a happy birthday**' etc.: 
- **I wish you every success** in the future.
- I saw Denis before the exam and **he wished me luck**.

We say 'wish somebody _something_' (luck/a happy birthday etc). But you cannot 'wish that smth _happens_'.
We use **hope** in this situation. For example:
- I **hope** you **get** this letter before you go away. (_not_ I wish you get)

Compare **I wish** and **I hope**:
- I **wish** you **a pleasant stay** here.
- I **hope** you **have** a pleasant stay here. (_not_ I wish you have)
