### Have to and must

#### Have to

I have to do smth = it is **necessary** to do it, I am obliged to do it:

- You can't turn right here. You **have to** _turn_ left.
- I **have to** _wear_ glasses for reading.
- Denis can't come out with us this evening. Ha **has to** _work_ late.
- I haven't **had to** _go_ to the doctor for ages. 

#### Questions and Negative sentences 

We use do/does/did in questions and negative sentences (for present and past simple):

- What **do** I **have to** _do_ to get a new driver licence? (_not_ What have I to do?)
- Lena doesn't have to work Saturdays? (_not_ Lena hasn't to)
- Why **did** you **have to** _leave_ early?

You can use **have to** with _will_ and _might/may_:
- If the pain gets worse, you'_ll_ **have to** go to the doctor.
- I _might_ **have to** work late tomorrow evening. or I _may_ **have to** work ... (= it's possible that I _will_ **have to**)

#### Must

Must is similar to have to:

|Same|Same|
|---|---|
|It's later than I thought. I **must** _go_.|It's later than I thought. I **have to** _go_|

You can use **must** to give your **opinion** (for example, to say what you think is necessary, or to recommend someone to do smth). Have to is also possible:

- I haven't spoken to Lena for ages. I **must** _phone_ her. (= I say this is _necessary_)
- Mark is really nice person. You **must** _meet_ him. (I _recommend_ this)

We use **have to** (_not_ must) to say what someone is **obliged** to do. The speaker is **not** giving his/her own **opinion**:

- I have to work from 11:00 am to 7:00 p.m. every working day. (a fact, not opinion)
- Lena has to travel a lot for her work.

But **must** is often used in written rules and instructions:
- (exam instructions) You **must** _write_ your answers in ink.
- Applications for the job **must** _be received_ by 18 May.

#### Don't use must in the Past

You can not use must to talk about the past:
- We **had** to leave early (_not_ we must)

#### Mustn't and don't have to

**Mustn't** and **don't have to** are completely different:

|mustn't|don't have to|
|---|---|
|You **mustn't** do smth = it is necessary that you do _not_ do it| You **don't have to** do smth = you don't need to do it (but you can if you want)
|Examples:| |
|You **must keep** it a secret. You **mustn't** tell anyone.|You **don't have to** tell him, _but you can_ if you want.

#### Have got to 

You can use **have got to** instead **have to**.

|Same|Same|
|---|---|
|I'**ve got to** work tomorrow|I **have to** work tomorrow|
