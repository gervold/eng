### Mixed Conditionals

Mixed conditionals are a combination of two types of conditional patterns (usually second and third conditionals).  

https://www.englishpage.com/conditional/mixedconditional.html

Mixed Conditionals may be:
- real
- unreal

#### Mixed Unreal Conditionals (MUC)

1) First MUC: a third conditional in the if clause and a second conditional in the main clause.  
Past action or state,  Present result. 
2) Second MUC: a second conditional in the if clause and a third conditional in the main clause.

#### First Mixed : `if` + `the past perfect` (3rd c), `would` + `verb` (2nd c)

_Past action or state,  Present result_

Notes: 
- usually, we use contractions If I'd had...
- very common, very important

Examples:
- If I _had had_ my coffee in the morning, I _would_ feel better now. 
- If I _hadn't drunk_ a lot of wine yesterday I _wouldn't_ have a bad feeling now.
- If I _hadn't shot_ that man, I _wouldn't be_ in jail.
- If I _hadn't had_ a fight last week I _wouldn't have_ a black eye.
- If I _had won_ the lottery when I was 25, I _would_ have a different life now.


#### Second: `if` + `the past simple` (2nd c), `would have V3` (3rd c)

_ongoing condition or actions that explain past behaviour_

Permanent condition that explains a past action, decision, consequence.

- If clause =  past condition and present condition
- main clause =  past action, decision, or result


Examples:

- if I _didn't like_ boards, I _wouldn't have been_ a snowboarder.
- If I _feared_ criminals, I _wouldn't have lived_ in Cape Town.
- If I _liked_ money, I _would have been_ a businessman.
- If I _wasn't_ afraid of spiders, I _wouldn't have screamed_ when one landed on me.
- If I _knew_ that FTX was corrupt, I _would not have invested_ in cryptocurrency (FTX is a crypto organization). 
- If I _was_ a genius, I _would have become_ an astronaut. 
- If we _knew_ that he was a criminal we _would have fired_ him.

Usual cases:
- If I could speak Chinese, ...
- If I didn't need sleep,...
- If I was a billionaire,...
