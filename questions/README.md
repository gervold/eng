#### 1. Normal

_Structure:_
auxiliary verb + subject + main verb.

In the present and past simple, where there is no auxiliary verb, add do/does or did:

- **Do** you **want** a coffee?
- **Can** you **help** me with my homework?

It's also possible to use question word with this structure:

- **What do** you **want** for lunch?

---

#### 2. Negative questions

You usually use negative questions when you _expect your listener to agree_, or in order to express _surprise_ or _annoyance_.

_Structure_: auxiliary verb + not + subject + main verb

- Isn't this food amazing? (expecting to agree)
- Didn't you like the book? (surprise)

It's also possible to use question word with this structure:
- Why don't you want to come with me?
---
#### 3. Short questions

Use short questions to express _surprise_ or _interest_, or to _encourage the other speaker to continue_.

_Structure_:  
auxiliary verb (+not) + subject.

- A: Lena complained about quite a few things in today's meeting.
- B: **Did she**? Like what?


- A: Denis hasn't been to any lectures this week.
- B: **Hasn't he**? Why not?

#### 4. Subject questions

You use subject questions to find out more information about a subject, e.g. a person or thing
that is performing an action.  

_Structure_:  
Who/What + verb + object

Do **not use auxiliary verbs** with subject questions because who or what is the subject of the question.

**Who** went with you?
**What** helps you study?
---
#### 5. Indirect questions

You use indirect questions when you want to be _more polite_.

_Structure_:  
subject + verb within part of a longer sentence. Unlike other types of questions, there is **no inversion** of subject and verb.

- Could you tell me where **the bus stop _is_**?
- **NOT**: ~~Could you tell me where _**is**_ **the bus stop**?~~

You often use indirect questions with a set phrase, e.q.:
- Could you tell me ...?
- Do you happen to know ...?
- Would you mind letting me know ...?
- Do you have any idea ...?

You can also form indirect questions as statements, using a set phrase:
- I'd like to know ...
- What I am asking is ...

The structure is also subject + verb.  
You can use _if_ or _whether_ after set phrase.

- **I'd like to know** _if_ tomorrow is a holiday.

#### 6. Question tags

Question tags are short phrases that you add to the end of a statement.

Use them to:
- check information. When you do this, you use a rising intonations in the tag question.
- ask the listener to agree. When you do this, you use a falling intonation.

_Structure_:
- If the statement is positive, add negative question tag
- If the statement is negative, add positive question tag
- If the statement includes proper noun, replace it with a pronoun in question tag.

Examples:
Examples:
- We are going for dinner on Friday, **aren't we**?
- You don't study at the university, **do you**?
- Lena isn't coming later, **is she**?
